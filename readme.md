# My dotfiles

Here are all the dotfiles for things that I care about.

## Requirements

Please ensure that you have both `git` and `stow` installed on your system.

## Usage

First, clone this repository into your `$HOME` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/motherofdaemons/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Then you can set up all of the symlinks by running.

```bash
stow .
```
